# eye-saver

Welcome to eye-saver! My first more serious project, the plan is too make a web application that will detect when you are watching your screen and based on it 
track how long you were staring into your screen, and notifying you on when you have viewed it for too long with a help of a counter.


Main goals:

      Beggining:
            - Able to detect your face
            - Fixed counter for looking away for n amount of time and looking into it
            - Custom counter for how long you want too stare into it and looking away.
            - Alerts(sound notification)
            - Functioning buttons
      Intermediate:
            - Customizable alerts (sound files)
            - Cookies
      Advanced:
            - Keeping track of your preferences.
            - Saving your alert file
